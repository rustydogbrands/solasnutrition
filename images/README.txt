This directory would contain all the image files for the Solas Nutrition website.

In a real implementation, this directory would include:
- Logo files
- Hero background images
- Team/dietitian photos
- Blog post featured images
- Testimonial client photos (with permission)
- Icons and other graphic elements

For this demo, we're using placeholder references in the HTML/CSS, but actual image files would need to be added here before deploying the site.
